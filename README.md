# Race Through Space

## A two-player, space themed board game.

The goal of Race Through Space is to be the first player to reach Earth from their starting point on some-orange-planet-far-far-away.

Taking turns, two players "roll dice" to move their spaceships forward on the board, hitting vortexes along the way, which move players forward, back, or challenge them to additional games for the chance to move extra spaces.

This is mostly a game of chance, dependent heavily on players' roll, but if players land on a "challenge" space, they can try to get ahead by beating their opponent at tic-tac-toe or catching screws flying around.

### To play

1. Enter player 1 and player 2's names (or name your spaceships!)
2. Click 'Go' to start the game
3. Click 'Roll'
4. Click on your spaceship game piece to move it forward

### Technology Used

HMTL, CSS, JavaScript

The game boards were created and styled using HTML and CSS, and the game's interactivity was developed with JavaScript

### User Stories

As a player, I can enter my player name for easier tracking of turns.

As a player, I click a button to stand-in for dice-rolling, to find out what spot I will move to.

As a player, my game piece moves forward or backward depending on the action assigned to each space and the number I "rolled".

As a player, I can play a sub game if I land on a "challenge" space, so the game is more interesting.

As a player, I know when I've won because it is announced clearly.

### Outstanding Challenges

The tic-tac-toe board and the catching challenge code needs to be refactored. This code is not DRY. But these are bonus games, so..

When a player lands on a "challenge" space, the intention was to allow them to choose whether they want to play a one- or two-player game. I broke the code, though, and neither supplementary game is resetting correctly after the first time it's played. Until this can be figured out, this has been detoured around and commented out.

When the challenge has already been played. I want there to be a message saying that the player doesn't have to do the challenge since it's been done. It's not working, so it's commented out.

### Future Work

As a player, I want additional challenge games for more excitement.

As a player, I want to choose my own avatar.

As a player, I want my piece to "fly" to it's next spot.

As a player, I want additional animations.
